# Failed Banks in the USA: Power BI Data Analysis and Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of failed banks across different states, years, and months in the United States. Built with Power BI, it leverages data visualization to uncover trends, geographic concentration, and temporal patterns in US bank failures, helping users quickly grasp key business insights through an interactive dashboard.

## Dataset Description

The analysis utilizes comprehensive data that includes:

- **Total number of failed banks by state**
- **Failed banks categorized by year**
- **Monthly breakdown of bank failures**
- **Granular view by city and state**

This dataset enables a holistic perspective on bank failures, from nationwide trends to localized insights, revealing correlations and temporal spikes in banking instability.

## Data Analysis Process

- **Data Preparation:** Raw data was imported into Power BI for cleaning and structuring.
- **Metrics Computed:**
  - Count of failed banks per state and year
  - Distribution of failures by month
  - Aggregation at the city/state level
- **Insights Extracted:**
  - Identification of states with the highest number of bank failures
  - Analysis of months with significant spikes in failures
  - Recognition of temporal trends indicating possible economic or seasonal factors

## Dashboard Features

The interactive Power BI dashboard offers:

- **Geo-maps** visualizing failed banks by state
- **Bar and line charts** highlighting yearly and monthly trends
- **Interactive filters** for drilling down by state, year, or city
- **Business insights display** summarizing the most-impacted regions and time periods

Users can dynamically explore how bank failures in the USA vary across time and location, enhancing decision-making and supporting further research.

## How to Use This Project

1. Open the Power BI (`.pbix`) file using Power BI Desktop.
2. Interact with visualizations to filter by state, year, or month as desired.
3. Review summary KPI cards for immediate business insights.
4. Dive deeper utilizing drill-down features for granular breakdowns.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop:** For data transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation
- **Power Query:** For data cleaning and aggregation
- **Data Visualization Tools:** Including bar charts, line charts, and dynamic filters

## Potential Extensions

- Integrate economic indicators for added contextual analysis
- Predict future bank failure trends using Power BI forecasting tools
- Connect to real-time data sources for up-to-date dashboards
